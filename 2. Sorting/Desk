Hi, I am Prasang, sophomore at VIT University, India. I want to contribute to mConference Framework (https://goo.gl/lzV4CI) as a part of GSoC'16.

I am having sufficient experience on Android App Development, along with the experience of an internship as an android app developer in a startup. I've also completed android app development certificate course from NIIT India. My previous projects which I've uploaded on playstore include: 

Cambuzz(https://goo.gl/Mek48c): Official app for my University. 
MotorBabu(https://goo.gl/ak1qBW): Developed during my internship period.
Drink/Drive(https://goo.gl/smPehJ): Personal project.
You can check my other apps on PlayStore: https://goo.gl/r6kzJC (PlayStore Account)

I would straightaway like to start building wireframes for mConference Framework. What further steps would you recommend at this point?

Regards,
Prasang.
